# Naive Bayes Classiication
Naive Bayes Classifier
What is Naive Bayes algorithm?
It is a classification method built on the Bayes Theorem and predicated on the idea of predictor independence. A
Naive Bayes classifier, to put it simply, believes that the presence of one feature in a class has nothing to do
with the presence of any other feature.
A fruit might be categorized as an apple, for instance, if it is red, rounded, and around 3 inches in diameter. Even
if these characteristics depend on one another or on the presence of other characteristics, each of these traits
separately increases the likelihood that this fruit is an apple, which is why it is called "Naive."
Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with
simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.
Bayes theorem provides a way of calculating posterior probability P(c|x) - (read as Probability of c given x), from
P(c), P(x) and P(x|c). Look at the equation below: >
